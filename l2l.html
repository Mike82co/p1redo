                <h1>Set the Stage!</h1>
                <p>I am learning to be better at setting goals for myself. Today i set a few short term goals. I tried to choose goals that are atinable and actionable.
                    I tried to be specific as well. Below is the list of the 4 goals I set for myself today.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Resubmit my CL drills</li>
                        <li>Ask at least three questions about things i dont understand in the breakouts</li>
                        <li>Take a new approach to the website drill. Do the CSS in smaller chunks.</li>
                        <li>Recognize when I am getting distracted and change my habbit immediately</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                <h1>Reflect</h1>
                <p>I attended a breakout on clean code and how to write your cod in a way that is easy to read. 
                        This was very helpful. I know I am not great at asking questions at these event so I mad sure this time to force myself to ask at least tree questions. 
                        I guess i don't like to feel dumb in front of other people so that is why i would never ask questions. Throughout the day I made sure to check back on with my goals.</p>

                    <h1>Set the Stage!</h1>
                    <p>Today I tried to deploy my proper learning stages. I was assigned a talk to be given tomorrow. This is about anything I choose. It was a bit short notice but i settled on a topic. I set out to remove as many distractions as I could. I have included a short video of me clearing my desktop. I also chose to use headphones today so I wouldn’t be drawn into random conversations. </p>

                    <h1>Reflect</h1> 
                    <p>By the end of the day i had a better understanding about what it is. I am still a little fuzzy on what we are passing when we use it but I can make them work. It progress and i think the more that I play and use them the more I will undestand them.</p>
