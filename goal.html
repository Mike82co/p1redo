            <h1>Goals for Today</h1>
                <ul class="goalList">
                    <li>Attend a Javascript breakout and ask at least three questions.</li>
                    <li>Spend at least 2 hours reading about CSS instead of trying to force the code to work.</li>
                    <li>Do three for four javascript drills.</li>
                    <li>Force myself to a quiet place to work.</li>
                </ul>
            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p>I met all four of these goals. At the Javascript breakout i did ask my three questions. I did not gain too much more of an understanding of the language but just thinking about in a different way was helpful. I did not spend the full two hours I set aside studying CSS. I again was getting a bit frustrated with it. I moved onto my javascript drills. I finally found the “Club Galvanize” area. That is a nice quiet place to get work done. I also left campus for lunch and sat in the park for a bit. This was helpful to clear my mind. As for tomorrow I am not sure i will do much different. The goals and how i approached them today worked out pretty well.</p>
