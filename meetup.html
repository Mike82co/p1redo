            <h1>Diversity in Tech Meetup</h1>
            <p>I went to the diversity in tech meetup held at galvanize. This was a meetup to discuss how to be more sensitive to diverse people in the workplace. The main presenter was a Transgender non binary person. They shared their story of their transition in the workplace. We were taken through what it means to be transgender and non binary. There were about 15 people in attendance. This meetup lasted about two hours and had very lively discussion. There was a very diverse mix of people in the session. There were people of color, women, and LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer).</p> 
            <p>I met one of the hosts of the event named Dan. Dan works as an app developer. For a company in boulder. I also met a Gentleman name UB. He works for a company that helps other companies find diverse employees. I did have casual conversations with a lot of the other people at the event. Everyone was very nice. Not everyone worked directly in the tech industry so it was nice to get different perspectives on this subject.</p>
            <ul>Questions I have
                <li>How can i apply what I learned about being sensitive to my current galvanize class.</li>
                <li>Is there something I could be doing better with respect to interacting with others.</li>
                <li>How would I best deal with a situation in which I felt offended.</li>
            </ul>

                <h1>National Womens Day Lightning Talks</h1>
                <p>I attended a meetup for national women's day with some fellow cohorts from Galvanize. This event was sponsored in part by “Women in Tech”. There were 7 speakers that gave lightning talks of about 9 min each. The topics were all over the map but focused on how to empower women in the workplace. While these lightning talks were for a female audience i did have a great many take aways from it.</p>
                <p>We heard form Vanessa Clark who is part of the group Women in space. She grew up in Australia. Australia does not have a space agency so she had to seek out a new place to pursue her passion. She landed in the UK and Later the US. She discussed how as a women she constantly has to prove herself to others in a mostly male dominated profession. I do not have a traditional schooling background and I am transitioning from an industry that has nothing to do with web development. I can relate to what she had to say.</p>
                <p>The second speaker was a person named Amanda. She is part of the Women in Tech group. She is a senior sales person for a software company. Her lightning talk was about the differences in how men and women think. She talked about how (in general) the genders are raised differently. Girls and Boys at an early age are taught to behave and feel certain ways. My big takeaway from this was her notion that “Feeling are not reality”. She hammered away about defeating self doubt. She spoke about how all of us feel that we are not good enough at times. This really spoke to me.</p>
                <p>I also met a very lovely lady named Amy. She is a entropauner that is trying to develop a service for expecting mothers to develop a “Birth Plan”. She is just starting out. She does not have a lot of money for her venture. I told her that we are a bunch of dev students and are looking for opportunities to showcase our skills. Hopefully down the road i can connect and do some freelance work for my portfolio.</p>
                <ul>Questions I have
                    <li>how can I better support my female cohorts and all cohorts?</li>
                    <li>Is there anything i might be doing inadvertently to hamper the progress of another cohort?</li>
                    <li>What could be a way i could recognize and overcome my own self doubt about becoming a developer?</li>
                    <li>What is the best way to keep a positive attitude when faced with difficult co-workers/cohorts?</li>

            <h1>Denevr Dev's Meetup</h1>
                <p>I Went to the denver devs meetup. This was a happy hour style meetup that was located at the “Rack House” in Rino. it was very well attended. I met a few people there. I met a guy named Ali. He and his brother own their own development company called Neon Rain. They are looking to add a developer for their team. He mostly works with Java and C Sharp. I did ask him a lot of questions about what he looks for when he is hiring. He had some good advice. He also said that he wouldn’t count anyone out if all they had was non-traditional schooling. That make me feel a lot better. </p>
                <p>I also talked with a lady by the name of Christen. She works for a placement firm in the tech industry. I had a very long and productive chat with her. We discussed a lot of things. We talked about what employers are looking for most and what other skills they looked for. She also gave me some great tips on how to approach interviews. One reassuring thing she pointed out was that soft skills are just as important as coding skills. A potential employer is not going to hire you if you do not work well with others. Luckily for me I can get along with just about anyone ;-).</p>
                <ul>Questions I have
                    <li>Is there anything i could be doing better to become a more marketable developer?</li>
                    <li>What kind of development environment would i thrive best in?</li>
                    <li>What other events can i attend to build up a peer network?</li>
                    <li>What other languages or technologies are in demand that i may not learn here?</li>
